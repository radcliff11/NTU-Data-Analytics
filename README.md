Project: 
Recommendation System for Football Selection Camp
 1. Pre-processing:    
    - Features for each class top 10    
 2. Classification (class)  
    - RFE    
    - Predict  
    - Conclusion  
    - Predict  
    - Conclusion  
 3. Clustering (class)   
    - K-Clustering  
    - DBSCAN (100 per class)  
    - RFE + PCA  
    - Predict with tupple name and position  
    - Identify outliers  
 4. Recommendation  
    - Given a new players stats which position is he most suited to play based on top features for each class.  
    - If he wants to transition to another position what attributes should he train.
